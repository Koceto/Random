# <div align="center">Selection Features</div>

>_This basic script has the job of adding special symbols around the selected word._

The idea of this script is to copy the _Visual Studio Code_ feature that allows you to select a **word** or **sentence** and click **Apostrophe** or **Asterisk** or whatever **other symbol** you need/want and place it **around** the **highlighted text**. This script works specifically with "_**textarea**_".


**The script is designed to be used with [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en).**
